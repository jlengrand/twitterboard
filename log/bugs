TODO:

Set all folders/parameters in prroperties files and do not have to modify code.



How is it possible to know which thread raised the error ? Output only says thread.py

enhancement : Session is redefined again and again over the code.
Create a class creating sessions to avoid code repetition.

sessions have to be closed!
normally, 5 concurrent sessions can be created within a pool

SOLVED:


Running command.py generates a database problem. Apparently due to passing session/connection between threads.

It is possible to create the same hashtag several times in the databse. => Add existence checks
